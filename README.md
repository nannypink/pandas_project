This was a project for week 2 of a numpy/pandas intro course with CoRise.

Live lectures were brilliant, clear and fun with a global learning cohort. The TA/peer assistance via Slack is amazing and there is also peer code review. 

If you want to learn data science I thouroughly recommend CoRise courses.
